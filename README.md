# Shapes-Detection
Overview

This project detects geometric shapes in images using OpenCV. The Jupyter Notebook processes images, applies edge detection, and identifies different shapes such as circles, triangles, and rectangles.

ðŸ”§ Features

âœ… Shape identification using contour approximation

âœ… Edge detection using Canny algorithm

âœ… Image processing with OpenCV

âœ… Works with pre-recorded images and live webcam feed
